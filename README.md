- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hayden-git
- 👀 I’m interested in ... bringing my background in education and activism to an industry that has the opportunity to improve the lives of people around the world! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, and mySQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... front-end projects to build my knowledge of web design! More than that though, I have a big dream to one day participate in a large scale project desining/maintaining a tool for activists around the world to remain anonymous from authoritarian powers. For example, tech like TailsOS offers a free and open-source operating system that can be booted from a USB drive, DVD, or SD card. Effectively offering privacy and anonymity by routing internet traffic through the Tor network, TailsOS is designed to leave no trace of user activity and includes built-in tools for encryption and secure communication. With the recent regime change on twitter, the social media site has lost its former spot as a global forum for activists to reshare acts of hate speech, police brutality, and more so that a global audience is aware (via FIRST HAND accounts) of what is going on in the world. That being said, Twitter's lack of competent managment has allowed their TOR (onion-browser) client to fall into total disrepair which means activists around the world are lacking basic tools for their anonymity. Somebody has to pick up the slack, right?
