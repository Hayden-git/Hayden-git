- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hayden-git
- 👀 I’m interested in ... bringing my background in education and activism to an industry that has the opportunity to improve the lives of people around the world! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, and mySQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... front-end projects to build my knowledge of web design! More than that though, I have a big dream to one day participate in a large scale project desining/maintaining a tool for activists to share literature and organize online without any threat of government or corporate overreach trying to deanonymize them.
