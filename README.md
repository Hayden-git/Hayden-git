- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hayden-git
- 👀 I’m interested in ... bringing my background in education and activism to an industry that has the opportunity to improve the lives of people around the world! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, and mySQL
- 💞️ Some info about me ... I am a musician turned full-stack developer with a passion for using technology to create positive change. With a background in tutoring college-level reading and writing, I am skilled at breaking down complex concepts and making them accessible to a wide audience. I am excited to be on this journey into tech and eager to contribute to projects that make a difference in the world. My ultimate goal is to use technology to unite activists globally and challenge the status quo that harms the environment and exploits third-world nations.
